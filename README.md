# Similarity Projection and Related Programs
## Description
This repository contains stable release(s) of the software developed in the course of my PhD candidature, and subsequent revisions.

The programs included in this repository implement aglorithms for sequence comparison. 
Work to date primarily focusses on biological sequence data, including protein and RNA, 
but the approach should be equally applicable to any sequentially structured symbolic data.

The general idea is to project biological sequences into a metric space using a technique 
similar to Vector Quantization, then use the metric of the embedding space to estimate the
evolutionary distance between the original sequences.
